# Bytecode Lox (blox)
## A Rust implementation of the Lox programming language
From the book "Crafting Interpreters", by Bob Nystrom. A copy of the book can be found on his [official website](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This implementation uses Rust rather than the language used in the book (C), so some of the implementation details are different. It is a work in progress.
